add some logger options, copied from a mail by WanMil

#####
Enable the logging by adding the following line to your logger 
configuration:
uk.me.parabola.mkgmap.osmstyle.StyledConverter.roads.level=INFO

This will create the following output for each road (routable lines):


          Road-OSM-Id Type       Flags Labels
	50408026 0x1  10000110000 [A1, A 1, E 37, null]

The bits have the following order:
oneway
no-emergency
no-delivery
no-throughroute
no-truck
no-bike
no-foot
carpool
no-taxi
no-bus
no-car

So the bit set 10000110000 means:
oneway, no-foot and no-bike

tweak some access-restrictions for base- and bikemap -- work in progress
path and track not per default unpaved
if unpaved they are not usable for routing
bicycle-routing for path should be excluded with bicycle=no, if 
width<=2.0 metres
track should be not routable if tracktype <=3

AIO-Bikemap
cycleroute highlighted
motorway and trunk nonroutable types

2013-02-09

AIO-basemap:
adjust some restrictions for barrier=bollard

AIO-bikemap:
add AIO-bikemap with changed routing-rules, work in progress,
it's difficult to adapt the way-types from motor-vehicles to bicycles
remove some overlays in 'lines'
use highway=path with bicycle=designated|yes as highway=cycleway
change road_speed for minor roads to adjust bicycle-routing (incomplete)
