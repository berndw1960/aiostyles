# Define the access restrictions
# The following tags define the restrictions:
# mkgmap:bicycle
# mkgmap:foot
# mkgmap:car

## A class is not allowed to use the way if its tag is set to 'no'
## The aim is to enable cycling without violating serious rules


## change rules order if access is set.
## access --> vehicle --> motor_vehicle (only DEU)

# The exact key/value combination access=designated should never appear on an object. 
# The value designated must be used with a specific mode of transport. 
# Examples: bicycle=designated or foot=designated.

# We will set the access rules later in this file
