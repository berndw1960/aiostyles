## set *cn_network for highlighting ways, we use three types, icn, rcn and lcn
## ncn and tcn are added to other types

# only the highest type of route network active!
# lcn = local cycle network
# rcn = region cycle network
# tcn = touristic cycle network only a few ways in Austria
# ncn = national cycle network
# icn = international cycle network
