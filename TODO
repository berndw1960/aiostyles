      "Jewelery" and a few others in Buchloe near the Rathaus
POIs 0x2e0c ff. are not correct in POI list

highway=services | highway=rest_area - deactivated in basemap and bikemap - maybe move to fixme layer  done
maybe wrong icon: shows a toilets icon and is "unnamed"

done, symbol and test changed


highway=passing_place shows up as "Punkt" example  https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/945286967
